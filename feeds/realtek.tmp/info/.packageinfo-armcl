Type: ipkg
Description:        The Compute Library is a collection of low-level functions optimized
       for Arm CPU and GPU architectures targeted at image processing,
       computer vision, and machine learning. It is available free of charge
       under a permissive MIT open source license.

       The Compute Library contains a comprehensive collection of software
       functions implemented for the Arm Cortex-A family of CPU processors
       and the Arm Mali family of GPUs. It is a convenient repository of
       low-level optimized functions that developers can source individually
       or use as part of complex pipelines in order to accelerate their
       algorithms and applications.
